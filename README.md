# Amazon-Review---Sentiment-Analyzer---NLP-Project

# 1. Context
This deep learning project puts deep learning concept into practice in particular to natural language processing - I am using the amazon review dataset to build a deep learning model that accurately identifies the sentiment of the review from users - neutral, positive or negative. 

# 2. Content and "file name"
NLP Sentiment Analyzer model: "Amazon Review - Sentiment Analyzer - NLP Project.ipny"
Sentiment Analyzer results: "Sentiment.csv"
Read me: This is the readme texts
Dataset (images/ train data/ test data): "amazon_reviews.csv"

# 3. Process and Results

- This is an exploratory project in which I have used VaderSentiment's Sentiment Intensity Analyzer to make this NLP model. When checking the final output (classification group of the sentiment of neutral, positive or negative), most are accurately pitted against its group but some minor mismtach was observed specific to comments such as "no issues" being classified as "negative. 

- However, the model is able to pick up complex reviews and allocate it correctly. For instance, the comment would have started off with a negative previous experience, but ends with a positive current experience then model is able to correctly identify the review as a "positive" review. 

- Note that this model still needs some review and updating.
